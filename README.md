**Overview**

This Windows application provides an integrated environment for managing files on a remote Raspberry Pi device via SSH. It offers functionalities similar to an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), enabling users to connect to a Raspberry Pi, open, edit, save, and create files, all within a graphical user interface (GUI).

**Features**

- SSH Connection: Connect to a remote Raspberry Pi device using SSH.
- Terminal Emulation: Execute commands on the Raspberry Pi via an embedded terminal.
- File Browser: Browse directories and open files on the Raspberry Pi.
- File Editing: Open files in separate tabs, edit them, and save changes back to the Raspberry Pi.
- File Creation: Create new files with specified extensions (.txt, .c, .py, etc.) directly from the application.
- Unsaved Changes Tracking: Track and indicate unsaved changes in open files.
- Path Validation: Verify if file paths exist and are within specified directories.
